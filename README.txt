Predicting Topic of the Text

Project overview
This project aims to train a Sequential Model to predict the topic of a given text. Using TensorFlow and Keras, we will preprocess text data, convert it into a suitable format, and train a neural network for accurate text classification.

Dataset
The data set is split into two csv files:
Train set: 2,801 rows, 5 variables.
Test set: 701 rows, 5 variables.
